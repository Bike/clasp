Clasp version 0.11

*  Added ASDF support.  
   This is still alpha.  Compile the ASDF module using (core:compile-asdf).
   After that you can load the module using (load "sys:kernel;asdf;build;asdf.bundle").
   It takes between 15-30 seconds to load (this is why I'm integrating Cleavir).
*  Added the :CLASP *feature* and removed the :ECL *feature*.
   Clasp will continue to mimic the underlying ECL functionality so that
   Common Lisp code that supports ECL can be made to support Clasp by converting
   #+ecl to #+(or ecl clasp)   and #-ecl to #-(or ecl clasp)
*  Added code to generate object files directly from Clasp.
   The LLVM bitcode compiler "llc" no longer needs to be in the PATH
   for Clasp to generate object files from Common Lisp source.
   The "ld" linker does need to be accessible.
