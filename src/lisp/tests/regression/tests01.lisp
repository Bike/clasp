      :description "A derivable class is a CLOS class that derives from a C++ class.
They are defined in the clbind library using Derivable<Foo>.
They must be seen as inheriting from the Instance_O class.
If they don't then any code that uses them won't work properly.
Check clasp/include/clasp/core/instance.h header file for the 
Instance_O specialization of TaggedCast")
